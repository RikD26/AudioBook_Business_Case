# Audiobook E-commerce Customer Retention Improvement

Welcome to the Audiobook E-commerce Customer Retention Improvement GitHub repository! This project is a solo endeavor, completed as part of the coursework for "The Complete Data Science Bootcamp" by 365 Career on Udemy. This project focuses on using a single Jupyter Notebook file, "P2 AUDIOBOOK BUSINESS CASE.ipynb," to enhance customer retention strategies for an audiobook e-commerce platform. Leveraging Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NumPy, and Pandas, this notebook provides valuable insights and code to improve customer retention in the audiobook industry.

## Project Overview

In the context of "The Complete Data Science Bootcamp" on Udemy, this project is an individual effort aimed at applying the data science skills and techniques learned throughout the course. The primary goal is to use machine learning and data analysis to address the challenge of keeping customers engaged and loyal in an audiobook e-commerce platform.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preparation

Within "P2 AUDIOBOOK BUSINESS CASE.ipynb," meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing have been performed to ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis. You'll find code sections for data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Discover insights about customer behavior and preferences through the EDA sections within the notebook. Gain a better understanding of the dataset's characteristics, explore trends, and uncover potential opportunities for retention improvements.

### 3. Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models have been developed within the same notebook to predict customer churn and identify factors contributing to it. Explore the model implementation and evaluation sections within "P2 AUDIOBOOK BUSINESS CASE.ipynb."

### 4. TensorFlow Implementation

For advanced predictive modeling, TensorFlow has been employed within the same notebook. Dive into the neural network model sections within "P2 AUDIOBOOK BUSINESS CASE.ipynb" to explore deep learning-based customer churn prediction.

### 5. Results and Insights

Findings and actionable insights are documented within the notebook. Key metrics are visualized, and recommendations for improving customer retention strategies based on the analysis are provided.
